# LRU Cache
● Designed and implemented a Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache in C++. Utilized doubly linked lists and hash 
maps to achieve fast and efficient cache operations. Implemented methods for adding, retrieving, and removing 
elements from the cache.

● Used the LRU algorithm to automatically evict least recently used items from the cache when it reaches its 
capacity. Optimized the cache performance by implementing various algorithms and data structures. Improved 
cache performance by implementing multithreading and concurrency techniques.
